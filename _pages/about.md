I am a pre-doctoral research assistant to Professor Amy Finkelstein at MITâ€™s economics department. My research interests are in labor and public economics, with a focus on the design of redistributive programs and the labor market outcomes of low-income workers. I graduated with a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University in May 2023.
