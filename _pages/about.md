I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Harvard University. My [research](https://rosakleinman.github.io/research/) interests are in labor and public economics, with a focus on the design of redistributive transfers and the determinants of labor market inequality. 

Previously, I worked as a pre-doctoral research assistant to Professor Amy Finkelstein. I graduated with a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University in May 2023.
