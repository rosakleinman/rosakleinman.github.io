I am a pre-doctoral research assistant to Professor Amy Finkelstein at MITâ€™s Economics Department. My [research](https://rosakleinman.github.io/research/) interests are in labor and public economics, with a focus on the design of redistributive transfers and the determinants of labor market inequality. I graduated with a BA in Economics and Mathematics from Yale University in May 2023.
