**Transaction Costs and the Take-up of Social Safety Net Programs: Evidence from the Combined Application Project**[[link]]\\
*submitted, October 2024*\\
This paper studies the effect of transaction costs on the take-up and targeting of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by exploiting the Combined Application Project (CAP), a widespread state-level policy designed to encourage SNAP enrollment among elderly recipients of Supplemental Security Income. I show that the CAP increased SNAP take-up by about 18%. The increase was suggestively larger among those with a higher probability of being food insecure. Of the various formats of the CAP, “auto-enrollment” into SNAP was most effective at increasing take-up.
