### "Transaction Costs and the Take-up of Social Safety Net Programs: Evidence from the Combined Application Project" [[link]](https://rosakleinman.github.io/files/Kleinman_CAP_Sept2024.pdf)
**Conditional Accept, *Journal of Policy Analysis and Management*,** September 2025 \\
This paper studies the effect of transaction costs on the take-up and targeting of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by exploiting the Combined Application Project (CAP), a widespread state-level policy designed to encourage SNAP enrollment among elderly recipients of Supplemental Security Income. I show that the CAP increased SNAP take-up by 3.75 percentage points, or about 18%. The increase was suggestively larger among those with a higher probability of being food insecure. Of the various formats of the CAP, “auto-enrollment” into SNAP was most effective at increasing take-up.
